# DatingApp
Web application built using ASP.NET Core API (.Net 5.0) and Angular 10

First you need to register your account, filling in details such as gender, first name, last name and the username you want to be displayed for other users. Since this is a dating app, you must also give your birth date, which needs to state that the user is at least 18 years old.
